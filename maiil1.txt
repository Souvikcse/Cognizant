Sub: Unable to mark attendance on biometric

Sir, 
	I received your mail on my absence for two consecutive days in the office. I would like to clarify on that.

	With due respect, I would like to state that the attendance punching machine has been not working since Monday, 28th January 2021.
	Because of this reason a lot of employees, including me are facing difficulty in marking their attendance.

	 
	Hence, I would request you to please consider my application and have a look in the issue. We have maintained a manual record 
	of our attendance. Please have a look at that.

Yours faithfully, 
Souvik
