Sub: Over Billing for last month
Dear Sir/Maam,
On Tuesday 9th of February, I received a bill for my postpaid connection for the month of feb and I have been charged the sum of 2000 INR.
The call duration stated on the bill is inaccurate because I was on a vacation for 15 days
and therefore did not use my airtel sim for that duration. Moreover, I have generally never received a bill of more than 1500 INR for one month.   
I would request that you review this bill and send me a revised, 
accurate bill in its place along with confirmation.   

Yours faithfully
